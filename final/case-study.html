            <h2>Process &amp; Insights</h2>
            <h3>Design Stage</h3>
            <p>To establish the site’s <strong>professional yet warm and comforting aesthetic,</strong> I began by brainstorming branding ideas. This resulted in the website’s name, Cookbook Corner, accompanied by a logo featuring a recipe book.</p>

            <p>After establishing the brand and feel, I created three design cards that showcased different combinations of font styles and color palettes. These options were <strong>presented to users for feedback,</strong> and the third card emerged as the clear favorite, providing the foundation for the website’s aesthetic direction. From this feedback, I developed a comprehensive <strong>style guide</strong> that established a cohesive set of colors and fonts, ensuring visual harmony throughout the site.</p>

            <img src="images/casestudy/cookbook_corner_style_tile.svg" alt="three cards" class="gallery-image">

            <p>With the branding solidified, I moved on to creating a <strong>high-fidelity wireframe </strong>to map out the website’s layout and navigation. Peer feedback on the wireframe was important in refining the user flow, ensuring the design supported seamless and intuitive navigation.</p>

            <p>In addition to ensuring usability, I wanted to add <strong>unique elements</strong> to make the website more engaging. To achieve this, I designed a homepage featuring a "Pick of the Day" section that <strong>randomizes a recipe daily</strong> (for demonstration purposes, it randomizes with every refresh), along with a "Latest Recipes" section to showcase newly added options. I also introduced a <strong>"Surprise!" button,</strong> allowing users to generate a random recipe when they’re unsure what to cook, adding a fun and interactive feature to the experience.</p>
            <img src="images/casestudy/cookbook_corner_wireframes.svg" alt="three cards" class="gallery-image">

            <h3>Development Stage</h3>
            <p>The development process began with <strong>creating the structure and layout</strong> of the website using HTML and CSS. To ensure consistency and efficiency, I used one recipe as a template to plan the structure of the pages to make sure that it was functioning as intended for responsive design. This initial stage served as a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for the project.</p>

            <p>With the front end established, the second phase of development focused on <strong>database integration and backend functionality.</strong> I set up a local server and MySQL database using <strong>MAMP</strong> to store the recipes and their attributes, including cuisine, protein, diet, and other keywords. Using PHP, I wrote scripts to dynamically <strong>fetch data</strong> from the database and insert it into the HTML templates. This allowed the website to transition from a <strong>static to a dynamic application,</strong> pulling live data for display.</p>

            <p>The final phase involved implementing the <strong>search and filtering functionality.</strong> I designed the interface to allow users to search by keywords and apply filters for cuisine, protein, and diet. On the backend, I utilized PHP to handle the <strong>queries and return relevant results</strong> dynamically. This process required significant troubleshooting and optimization to ensure smooth and accurate filtering across multiple criteria.</p>

    <!-- Takeaways -->

        <div class="section-content">
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>This project <strong>helped me grow technically,</strong> gaining essential skills in PHP and MySQL for server-side scripting. I successfully overcame challenges in database integration and query handling, learning how to <strong>efficiently fetch and display data.</strong> Balancing backend functionality with front-end design allowed me to deliver a polished final product.</p>

            <p>Throughout the 10-week timeline, I managed multiple deliverables while iterating on user feedback. Moving forward, I plan to make the site <strong>more personalized and interactive</strong> by adding features like creation of recipes, the ability to edit or delete them, and a more distinct flow between guest and logged-in users. There is also <strong>still room for improvement,</strong> especially in terms of optimization, but I am eager to continue learning and refining my skills for future projects.</p>
